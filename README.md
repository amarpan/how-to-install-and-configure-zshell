# How to Install and Configure Z Shell in Ubuntu Linux

Z Shell (zsh) is a popular alternative to the default command line bash shell due to its improved features like recursive path expansion, automatic spelling correction, and plug-in and theme support. 

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and configuring zsh, including how to change themes and enable the time-saving autosuggestions plug-in. 

## Before You Begin

Complete the following steps prior to getting started:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/):

```
sudo apt install curl wget git
```

## Installation

1. Install [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/):
```
sudo apt install zsh
```

2. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/):
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You should now see the following prompt asking if you'd like to change your defaut shell to zsh. Type `y` to confirm.

Take a look at your command line and you'll notice the difference right away.

{{< note >}}

If for any reason you need to switch back to the bash shell, use the following command: 
```
chsh -s $(which bash)
```
Proceed to log out and back into your session for the change to take effect.

Run `echo $SHELL` to confirm the output is `/bin/bash`

## Change Zsh Theme
By default, the theme is set to `robbyrussell`. However, this is rather plain and there are over 100+ included themes with a wide assortment of colors and styles to choose from. 

For example, here are 3 uniquely different themes to choose from:

1. jonathan

2. xiong-chiamiov
![Xiong Chiamiov Theme Preview](xiong-chiamiov-theme-preview.png)

2. agnoster
![Agnoster Theme Preview](agnoster-theme-preview.png)





Follow these steps to change themes to `jonathan`:

1. Open your zsh configuration file:
```
vi ~/.zshrc
```
2. Press `i` to enter Insert Mode.

3. Change the ending of the line reading
```
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```
to
```
ZSH_THEME="jonathan"
```

4. Press `ESC` to leave Insert Mode and enter Command Mode.

5. Type `:wq` + `ENTER` to save and quit.

6. Reload the command line:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

7. Check out your newly themed command line and repeat steps 1-6 with a few more themes to find the best fit.

8. To see the full list of locally available zsh themes, follow these steps:

    a. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`

    b. `ls`

## Enable Autosuggestions
The autosuggestions plug-in is quite possibly the single most time-saving tool when coding. Instead of having to type the same command over and over again in full, this plug-in automatically suggests the rest of your command as you are typing, without even having to press `TAB`. 

For example, instead of having to type `git push origin main` every single time you wish to push a new commit, you can instead type `git push` and the command line will automatically show a preview of the rest of the suggested command based on your shell's history.

Follow these steps to install and enable the autosuggestions plug-in:

1. Change directories to the oh-my-zsh plug-ins location:
```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/
```

2. Clone the autosuggestions plugin packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```
3. Edit the zsh configuration file:

    a. `vi ~/.zshrc`

    b. Press `i` to enter Insert Mode

    c. Update the line beginning with `plugins=()` to
    `plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)`

    d. Type `:wq` + `ENTER` to save and quit. 

4. Reload the command line for the changes to take effect:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

5. Try it out! Start typing a command you know to be in your shell's history and watch as zsh offers auto-complete suggestions. After seeing a suggestion that you'd like to approve, press the `Right Arrow` key to accept it.
