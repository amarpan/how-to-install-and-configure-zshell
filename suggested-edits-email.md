Hi Andy,

Just submitted a pull request for my guide on How to Install and Configure Zsh on Ubuntu.
You can find it on GitHub here or under docs/guides/tools-reference/tools/how-to-install-and-configure-zsh-ubuntu 
I've also attached a Google Drive folder of the index.md and screenshots in case you can't view it on GitHub.

Can you please suggest any edits and approve for invoicing? 

Thank you,

Amar Pan
