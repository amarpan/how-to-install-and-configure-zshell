Hi Andy,

Just submitted a pull request for my guide on How to Install and Configure Zsh on Ubuntu. You can find it under docs/guides/tools-reference/tools/how-to-install-and-configure-zsh-ubuntu

Can you please suggest any edits and approve for invoicing? I've attached a Google Drive folder of the index.md and screenshots in case you can't view it on GitHub.

Thank you,

Amar Pan
